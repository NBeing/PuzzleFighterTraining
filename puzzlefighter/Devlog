Overaching Goals
1. Make a quality training mode that let's players practice the game in a open environment
2. make some extra functions that lets users practice in new ways
3. Spite Capcom 


Smaller Goals/Possible Features
1. pressure play function
 - P2 sends user repeated blows of X amount of garbage (with customizable timing between attacks)
2. stopping P2 from dropping pieces 
3. being able to delete garbage/pieces after dropping
4. simple save states
5. RNG seed entry/piece queue manipulation
6. Drought timer
7. Diamond glitch gui
8. pieces dropped/ pieces til diamond
9. Margin time options
10. Handicap options
=======================================6/2/2022=========================================

* Made hotkey functions to reduce gems sent to a player

* did N-Bee's exercises on using LUA

=======================================6/3/2022=========================================

* found the Memory address values for the current vertical height of a piece
     - FF8315(P1) & FF8715(P2)
* tried to keep the value constant with both MAME debugger and lua script, but no dice for now
* looks like I made a mistake with hex counting. 
*piece disappears if you hold down while soft dropping
 -soft drop keeps the piece suspended in mid air
*rotation get's kinda wacky (nvm this was just top board shenanigans)
=======================================6/4/2022=========================================
*made a MAME cheat to keep p2 piece at top board
=======================================6/5/2022=========================================
*mighta been today or yesterday, but I made a function that will automatically give diamonds on command, but the most it can give out is 10 diamonds in one match. (puzzlefighter/diamond.lua)
probably has something to do with my not understanding hex math that much, but it's probably something hardcoded into the game

*K.S. told me the addresses I was using for diamond counting and pieces dropped were wrong. They're words, not bytes, so they use more digits in the RAM and that made counting funky when I told the lua to read it as a byte. tysm hacker dog ^-^.

=======================================6/6/2022=========================================
*tried to refactor the current GUI into a separate module. Didn't work 
*cleaning up some stuff before I push this to Git so NBee can help with the menu stuff
