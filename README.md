# PuzzleFighterTraining
Package to help puzzle fighter players practice chains and other stuff with the Arcade ROM of puzzle fighter
place both the `run_spf2t_training.bat` and `puzzlefighter` folder in `/Fightcade/emulator/fbneo` folder (try to make sure there are no spaces in your filepath)

Run `run_spf2t_training.bat` to fire up training mode. It should work with either arcade or 2p about the same.

## Hotkeys
Lua hotkeys for special actions atm (bind them using FBNeo input options)

`Start`   : Open up the menu

`Hotkey 1`: Send queue'd Gems to both players

`Hotkey 2`: Get a free diamond

`Hotkey 3`: Change character/pattern of p1

`Hotkey 4`: Change chracter/pattern of p2

`Hotkey 5`: Add 5 garbage to be sent to P2

`Hotkey 6`: Add 5 garbage to be sent to P1

`Hotkey 7`: Minus 5 garbage from P2 queue

`Hotkey 8`: Minus 5 garbage from P1 queue

Set P2 garbage queue to 0 and send to reset damage so you can check how much you're doing on separate combos/attacks 

Margin time is still active, so reset if you wanna avoid that.
