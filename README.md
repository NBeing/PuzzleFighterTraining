Idk we're still working on it. 
Instructions:
Lua hotkeys for special actions atm (bind them using FBNeo input options)
1: send queue'd Gems to both players
2: get a free diamond
3: change character/pattern of p1
4: change chracter/pattern of p2
5: Add 5 garbage to be sent to P2
6: Add 5 garbage to be sent to P1
7: Minus 5 garbage from P2 queue
8: Minus 5 garbage from P1 queue

set P2 garbage queue to 0 and send to reset damage so you can check how much you're doing on separate combos/attacks 
Margin time is still active, so reset if you wanna avoid that.
